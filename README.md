# color-shades-generator

Give it a HEX color, & it will give you 10 dark and light shades of it. Also converts the HEX color to its RGB & HSL conversions.
## How it works

It uses [color](https://www.npmjs.com/package/color) package to do all the work.

## Limitations

- It may throw repeated colors in case the input color itself is very light or dark in color.
- Accepts only #HEX (eg. #ddd, #2c3e50, #f34949) colors for now. and the Shades are currently #HEX only.


This is in it's very initial phase, probably not very helpful this time but this will improve over the time. If you wanna contribute, please look at the code, make your changes and raise a PR. :)
